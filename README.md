# himalaya_camps

A dynamic and responsive website for Himalaya Camps, a well-known tourism company that specializes in trekking, camping, adventure, and yoga. I developed a visually beautiful and user-friendly platform that successfully exposes the organization's offerings by utilizing my knowledge in HTML, CSS, SCSS, jQuery, JavaScript, AJAX, and PHP. 
The website has a variety of sites, such as a home page with general information, a gallery with many photographs, a about page giving the background and history of the organization, a packages page listing all the packages the organization offers, a contact page, and specific pages for each destination.
